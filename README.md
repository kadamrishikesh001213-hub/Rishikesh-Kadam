-----Python Password Generator-----
About the Project:
This is a simple and useful tool built with Python. In today's world, using passwords like "123456" is dangerous. This program helps you create strong, random passwords instantly. It ensures your passwords are hard to guess by mixing different types of characters.

Key Features:
You Control the Length: You can choose how long the password should be (e.g., 8 digits, 12 digits).

Custom Complexity: You decide if you want to include Numbers (0-9) or Special Symbols (@, #, $).

Error Proof: If you type something wrong (like text instead of a number), the program won't crash; it will just ask you again.

Fast & Safe: Everything runs on your own computer, so your passwords are private.

Requirements:
You only need Python 3 installed on your computer.

No extra downloads or internet connection required.

How to Run the Code:
Save the python file as password_gen.py.

Open your Command Prompt or Terminal.

Go to the folder where you saved the file.

Type the following command and press Enter:
python password_gen.py
Follow the questions on the screen (enter length, type 'y' or 'n' for symbols).

Example Output:
When you run the program, it will look like this:

Plaintext

Enter password length: 10
Include Numbers? (y/n): y
Include Symbols? (y/n): y

Generated Password:  Kj9#mP2$vL
